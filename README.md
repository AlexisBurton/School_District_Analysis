# School District Analysis
## Objective
The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the performance of schools in the district. We  want to see not only how the students are doing in reading and math, but also if there is any correlation between student scores and school characteristics (i.e. school type, school size, per capita spend rate).

Additionally, after being notified of possible academic dishonesty in an isolated group, we ran parallel analysis to see how the removal of tainted data affected the overall results.

## Results
Overall, the tainted data seems to have had little effect over the results. The changes are summarized below. 
- District Summary
	The tainted data represented roughly 1% of the total data, so it is little surprise that its removal produced negligible change. Four of the five reporting points did not have enough of a change to be reflected in reporting format, and the one that did change, Average Math Score, only dropped by one tenth of a point.
